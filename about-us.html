      <h1>About Us.</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the H2O Revolution!</p>
      <p>
        Once upon a time in 2004, in the bustling heart of Tambaram, Chennai, a
        startup was born to conquer water impurities and bring pure, delicious
        water to every household and business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward 20 years, and we've become the seasoned heroes of water
        purification with the magic of reverse osmosis.
      </p>
      <p>
        We tackle both household and commercial needs, even taming the wildest
        water with our trusty water softeners. We handle both sales and
        service—your one-stop-shop for pure water!
      </p>
      <p>
        Our secret weapon? The mighty Hi-Tech brand. Hi-Tech started by importing
        purification plants from the USA but soon began assembling them in India to
        improve service and availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        To boost efficiency and cut costs, Hi-Tech began producing essential parts
        needed for domestic water purifiers. As demand grew, Hi-Tech expanded
        production and set up units across the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every purifier we craft comes with a Total Dissolved Solid adjuster,
        ensuring water is treated to perfection, retaining essential salts and
        minerals for super healthy water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hi-Tech doesn't just stop at households. We provide clean water to
        schools, colleges, hospitals, and remote villages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our ultimate quest? To provide you with water so pure, it has 0% unwanted
        minerals and 100% satisfaction. Join us in making every drop count!
